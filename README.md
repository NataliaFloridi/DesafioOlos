# Desafio Olos

Desafio Olos - API Nasa - 7 days.

## What is the project?

- Creating a webpage using Nasa´s Asteroids - NeoWs - API;
- Find for last 7 days asteroids filtered by date and search for asteroid´s name;
- Each list item has asteroid´s name, max and min estimated diameter in km, miss distance from earth and information if the asteroid is potentially hazardous;

## Why not React? 

- This project should be made by using ract or another framework;
- For now, I´m not able to coding by using react as I´m a newbie in development task;
- I did my best by using things that i know and reserching others that i dont´t;
- This project and challenge made me grown tecnically, and believe in myself;
